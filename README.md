# The Byte Shop

A Pedagogical SPV Example

## What Is This?

Step right up! Buy your very own unique set of random bytes! For the low low price of only 100 satoshis each, we are selling bytes of random data. Minimum 10 per order. Exclusions apply. Batteries not included. Made in China, just kidding not really. **Must pay in BSV with FULL SPV, yes really**!

### Ok, what is this *REALLY*?

This is an open-source example of a merchant running a server to accept SPV payments in Bitcoin over the internet in exchange for digital goods or servicesâ€”in this case, pseudo-random bytes of data.

It uses Paymail and the Babbage suite of tools. The merchant configures the server with their Paymail address, where they will receive their satoshis. The server proxies requests to Paymail, checking that the payments were accepted and furnishing the goods to the customer if so.

This works with legacy wallets as well, but will print warnings to the console if the merchant's paymail server is incapable of accepting SPV envelopes. Wallets like MoneyButton and HandCash do not yet support SPV envelopes, but if you have a [Babbage Desktop](https://projectbabbage.com) account, you are good to go.

## Setting Up

This runs on the infinitely-scalable Google App Engine platform. You will need a database, an App Engine project and GitHub Actions configured for your fork of this repo.

You will need `gcloud` command line tools set up. You will need to run `gcloud auth login` and configure it to use the correct project. To do this, run `gcloud config configurations create your-cfg-name`, then `gcloud config set account your-email@domain.tld` and finally `gcloud config set project your-project-id`.

Create a Cloud SQL instance (MySQL is what has been tested) and create a new user. Also create a new database inside the new instance. Make note of the username, password, host name and database name you want to use. Alternatively, you can use another database hosting solution.

Go to the App Engine page and select a region. Use the same region as your Cloud SQL instance for best performance. Once the App Engine application has been created, go to Settings and add two custom domains: one for staging and one for production.

Go to GitHub repository settings and populate the repository secrets defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.staging.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy.production.yml`.

- STAGING_NODE_ENV is `staging`
- PROD_NODE_ENV is `production`
- STAGING_ROUTING_PREFIX and PROD_ROUTING_PREFIX are not needed unless you want them
- STAGING_HOSTING_DOMAIN is the domain name you configured for staging
- PROD_HOSTING_DOMAIN is the domain name you configured for production
- STAGING_KNEX_DB_CONNECTION is a JSON object describing the connection to your staging database. For example, `{"port":3306,"host":"10.1.1.1","user":"yourstagingusername","password":"yourstagingpassword","database":"your_staging_db"}`
- PROD_KNEX_DB_CONNECTION is a JSON object describing the connection to your production database. For example, `{"port":3306,"host":"10.1.1.1","user":"yourprodusername","password":"yourprodpassword","database":"your_prod_db"}`
- STAGING_KNEX_DB_CLIENT and PROD_KNEX_DB_CLIENT are both `mysql`
- STAGING_MIGRATE_KEY and PROD_MIGRATE_KEY are the migration keys that can be used by the server administrator with the `/migrate` API endpoints to run new database migrations. Since staging and production use different databases, their migrations are handled separately, and different migration keys should be used for each.
- STAGING_GCP_PROJECT_ID and PROD_GCP_PROJECT_ID are usually the same, unless you have different Google Cloud projects for each deployment. Set them to the project ID where App Engine is running.
- STAGING_SERVER_PAYMAIL is where you want to receive your profits from the staging server.
- PROD_SERVER_PAYMAIL is where you want to receive your profits from the production server. Feel free to set this ty `ty@tyweb.us` if you want to give me all of your profits :p (or for testing)

After this is done, write a commit and push it to the `production` branch. Check that the App Engine production deployment succeeded in GitHub Actions. After it works, pull your new commit into `master` and ensure that the staging deployment succeeds. You will need to deploy the production branch before the master branch, as the first App Engine service must always be `default`.

To get your custom domains to route to the right places, after your deploys are working, modify `dispatch.yaml` in your fork of the repo with the domains you set up earlier. Deploy the new routing rules from your loal terminal with `gcloud app deploy dispatch.yaml`. Commit the change to `master` and the staging deployment should run once more.

Once your custom domains are working, you will need to migrate both the staging and production databases to create the schema after deployment. Use the `/migrate` API endpoints on both deployments with the migration keys you have configured.
