# The Byte Shop

A Pedagogical SPV Example

## What Is This?

Step right up! Buy your very own unique set of random bytes! For the low low price of only 100 satoshis each, we are selling bytes of random data. Minimum 10 per order. Exclusions apply. Batteries not included. Made in China, just kidding not really. **Must pay in BSV with FULL SPV, yes really**!

### Ok, what is this *REALLY*?

This is an open-source example of a merchant running a server to accept SPV payments in Bitcoin over the internet in exchange for digital goods or servicesâ€”in this case, pseudo-random bytes of data. This is a reference implementation of a simple Babbage app server.

It uses the Babbage suite of tools to peroform the purchase of the bytes. The buyer sends a request for a number of bytes to be purchased from the merchant. The merchant returns an invoice to the buyer for the number of bytes requested. Provided the buyer sends the merchant the correct payment, as detailed on the invoice, the merchant returns the bytes and a note thanking the buyer for their purchase.
